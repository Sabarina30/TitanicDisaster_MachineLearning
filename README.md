# TitanicDisaster_MachineLearning
This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. It serves as a classic introductory machine learning project for those interested in data science and predictive modeling.
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of over 1,500 passengers and crew. This project attempts to predict whether a given passenger survived or not using machine learning algorithms.
## Evaluation metric
The evaluation metric of this competition is the percentage of passenger data in the test set that are correctly predicted by our model. This is known as accuracy.
## Data description
Below are the description of the features in the data:

          Survival: 0 = Dead, 1 = Survived
          Pclass: Ticket class where 1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class. 
          Sex: Male or female
          Age: Age in years, fractional if less than 1
          SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the titanic
          Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the titanic
          Ticket: Passenger ticket number
          Fare: Passenger fare
          Cabin: Cabin number
          Embarked: Point of embarkation where C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
